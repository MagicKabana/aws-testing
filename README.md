# aws-testing

## Setup

* Create secrets.json with the right keys (AccessKeyId, SecretKey, Region) in json format
* Debug script until hair falls out
* Read conflicting AWS documentation (https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-ruby and http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSdkDocsRuby/latest/DeveloperGuide/prog-basics-creds.html) until you fall asleep on your laptop
